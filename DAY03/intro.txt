//today we are going to talk about the jsx and babel

//what will npm 

//what is the difference between the dependenices and devdependencies 


//browserlist :
//this is not mean that whatever i will write there it will work on that paritcular browsser 
//it means that it will must work on that browser 
//it it might or might not work on that browser 


//we need to convert the new code to older version of the code

//polyfill ---> replacement of the new version of the code 
//what convert our new code to older code ---> BABEL WILL DO IT FOR IT 

//

IT IS VERY TIDIOUS TO WRITE THE
npx parcel index.html 
----> 

then we use the script in our packet.json which runs this command in easy way 

"start":"parcel index.html"

npm is when you want to install 
npx is used to exectute 

//it is like npm-run ==npx

//web-pack is alternative for the parcel 

//every bundler 

like vite 

//create react use web-pack along with babel 

//web-pack is used for large scale  



//in the package.json 
file we have to add something in scripts 

//like 
    "start" :"parcel index.html"
    "build" : " parcel build index.html"
//while did we skip npx because npx is just extacally npm 
    npx is used for the  execturing 

    npx == npm run (gernal y)


    npm run build ---> this command will run our command
    npm run start will run our code 



//console.log is not automatically removed 
if we want to do so 

then we have to use 

babel-plugin-transform-remove.console
