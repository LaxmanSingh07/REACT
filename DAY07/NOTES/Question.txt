why do we use super in js 

how setState work behind the seen 


//first of all constructor is called then render 


what is componentDidMount


first of all constructor then render then componentDidMount is called 

what are the differencet lifecycles method inside react 





there are two phases render phase and commit phase

in render phase constructor and render are called 

in commit phase componentDidMount


render phase for all of the component will be called 



//when we use useEffect then we can't function to async


why can we make componentDidMount async but callback not async 


//never ever react lifecycles method to the functional component

mount update and unmount these are threee different things 

what is SPA















research

super(props)

async can't use inside useEffect why?
