## `REACT`

(made by facebook)

React is a `declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library` for
building user interfaces or `UI` components. It lets you compose complex UIs
from small and isolated pieces of code called **`“components”`**.


_**`REACT CAME WITH THE IDEA THAT HTML AND CSS INSIDE THE JAVASCRIPT`**_

## Note:

```
you can add react in any
part of your existing code this is beauty of react

```
```
WHEN WE HAVE TO PASS THE MULTIPLE CHILD WE CALL THEM AS CHILDREN
we put them inside an array
```

_Syntax_

```sh
const container=React.createElement("div",{
    id:"container"
},[heading1,heading2])

```

`THIS IS NOT USER FRIENDLY THAT'S WHY JSX CAME INTO THE PICTURE`
