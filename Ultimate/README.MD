--------------------------


### TAILWIND CSS 

👉 “A utility-first CSS framework packed with utility classes like flex, text-center and 
rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup (HTML or JSX)”

👉 **Utility-first CSS approach**: writing tiny classes with one single purpose, and then combining them to build entire layouts

👉 In tailwind, **these classes are already written for us**. So we’re not gonna write any new CSS, but instead use some of tailwind’s hundreds of classes

## THE GOOD AND BAD ABOUT TAILWIND CSS

|THE GOOD|THE BAD|
|--------|-------|
|👉 You don’t need to think about class names|👉 Markup (HTML or JSX) looks very unreadable, with lots of class names (you get used to it)|
|👉 No jumping between files to write markup and styles|👉 You have to learn a lot of class names (but after a day of usage you know fundamentals)|
|👉 Immediately understand styling in any project that uses tailwind|👉 You need to install and set up tailwind on each new project|
|👉 Tailwind is a design system: many design decisions have been taken for you, which makes UIs look better and more consistent|👉 You’re giving up on “vanilla CSS” |
|👉 Saves a lot of time, e.g. on responsive design|👉 Many people love to hate on tailwind for no reason. Please don’t be that person! Try it before judging |
|👉 Docs and VS Code integration are great|
