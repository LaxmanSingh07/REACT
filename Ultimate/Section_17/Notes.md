## What is ROUTING? 


### Routing (Client-Side Routing)

ðŸ‘‰ With routing, we match **different URLs to different UI views** (React components): **routes**
ðŸ‘‰ This enables users to **navigate between different applications screens**, using the browser URL
ðŸ‘‰ Keeps the UI in **sync** with the current browser URL
ðŸ‘‰ Allows us to build Single-Page Applications

`REACT THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES` : **ReactRouter**


## **SINGLE-PAGE** APPLICATIONS (SPAs)


ðŸ‘‰ Application that is **executed entirely on the client** browsers

ðŸ‘‰ **Routes:** diffent URLs correspond to different views (Components)

ðŸ‘‰ **JavaScript** (React) is used to update the page (DOM)

ðŸ‘‰ **The page is never reloaded**

ðŸ‘‰ Feels like a **native app**

### SPA RUNNING ON CLIENT ðŸ’»
