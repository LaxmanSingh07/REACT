## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION TOOLS 

### 1. Prevent wasted Renders 

        ğŸ‘‰ memo
        ğŸ‘‰ useMemo
        ğŸ‘‰ useCallback
        ğŸ‘‰ Passing element as children to regular prop

### 2. Improve app speed/reponsiveness

    ğŸ‘‰ useMemo
    ğŸ‘‰ useCallback
    ğŸ‘‰ useTransition


### 3. Reduce bundle size

    ğŸ‘‰ Using fewer 3rd package 
    ğŸ‘‰ code splitting and lazy loading 


ğŸ‘‹ This list of tools and techniques is, by no means, exhaustive. Youâ€™re already doing 
many optimizations by following the best practices I have been showing you âœŒ
