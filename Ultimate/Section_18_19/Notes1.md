## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION TOOLS 

### 1. Prevent wasted Renders 

        ðŸ‘‰ memo
        ðŸ‘‰ useMemo
        ðŸ‘‰ useCallback
        ðŸ‘‰ Passing element as children to regular prop

### 2. Improve app speed/reponsiveness

    ðŸ‘‰ useMemo
    ðŸ‘‰ useCallback
    ðŸ‘‰ useTransition


### 3. Reduce bundle size

    ðŸ‘‰ Using fewer 3rd package 
    ðŸ‘‰ code splitting and lazy loading 


ðŸ‘‹ This list of tools and techniques is, by no means, exhaustive. Youâ€™re already doing 
many optimizations by following the best practices I have been showing you âœŒ

## When Does a Component instance RE-RENDER?

## The Profiler Dev Tool

This dev tool is used to measure the performance of a React app. It can be used to

- Flamegraph: visualize how much time it takes to render each component

The color of the component specifies the time it takes to render the component or the component is re-rendered or not.

`The reson of the re-rendering is also shown in the flamegraph.`
