## Component Categories

`Most of you components will naturally fall into one of three categories`

1. Stateless/ presentational components
2. Stateful/ container components
3. Structural components

### Stateless/ presentational components

     - No State
     - Can receive props and simply present received data or other content 
     - Usually small and reusable


### Stateful/ container components

     - State
     - Can receive props and manage state
    
### Structural components

    👉 “Pages”, “layouts”, or “screens” of the app
    👉 Result of composition
    👉 Can be huge and non-reusable (but don't have to)
