## WHAT IS REACT QUERY? 

ğŸ‘‰ Powerful library for managing **remote (server) state**

ğŸ‘‰ Many features that allow us to write a **lot less code**,while also **making the UX a lot better**:

    ğŸ‘‰ Data is stored in a cache

    ğŸ‘‰ Automatic loading and error states

    ğŸ‘‰ Automatic re-fetching to keep state synched

    ğŸ‘‰ Pre-fetching

    ğŸ‘‰ Easy remote state mutation (updating)

    ğŸ‘‰ Offline support

ğŸ‘‰ Needed because remote state is **fundamentally** different from regular (UI) state
