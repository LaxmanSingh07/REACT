## What is State in React 

`State` is a bascically a data that a component `can hold over time` necessary for information that it needs to remember throughout the app's lifecycle.

`Component's memory` is the `State` of the component.

`State Variables` / `piece of state` : A single varible in a component (component state )  (we use the term interchagebly)

`Updating component` state triggers React to `re-render the component `

### State Allows Devlopers to: 

`Update the component's view` (by re-rendering it )
Persist local variables between renders 

`State is a tool.` Mastering state will unlock the power of React Development.
