React is all about the component 

Component As Building Block

- Components 

    -  ğŸ‘‰ React applications are entirely made out of components
    -  ğŸ‘‰ Building blocks of user interfaces in React 
    -  ğŸ‘‰ Piece of Ui that has its own data,logic and apprearance (how it works and looks)
    -  ğŸ‘‰ We build complex Uis by building mulitple components and nesting them inside each other
    -  ğŸ‘‰ Components can be reused,nested inside each other, and pass data between them
