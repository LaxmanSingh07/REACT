React is all about the component 

Component As Building Block

- Components 

    -  ðŸ‘‰ React applications are entirely made out of components
    -  ðŸ‘‰ Building blocks of user interfaces in React 
    -  ðŸ‘‰ Piece of Ui that has its own data,logic and apprearance (how it works and looks)
    -  ðŸ‘‰ We build complex Uis by building mulitple components and nesting them inside each other
    -  ðŸ‘‰ Components can be reused,nested inside each other, and pass data between them 


Component 

 - Data
 - Logic
 - Apprearance
## What is JSX

-  ðŸ‘‰ JSX is a syntax to describe what components should look like and how it work
-  ðŸ‘‰ Component must return a block of JSX
-  ðŸ‘‰ Extension of js that allows us to embed JavaScript, Css and React Component into Html
-  ðŸ‘‰ JSX is there but we could usee React without JSX
### What is Babel 

- Babel is a `transpiler` that converts `JSX into browser readable` JavaScript

Babel is automatically installed when we install react




### JSX IS DECLARATIVE

Imperative (How to do things )

- Manual DOM element selections and DOM traversing
-  Step by Step Dom manipulation until we reach the desired result


### Declarative (What to do)

- Describe what Ui should look like using JSX, based on current data
