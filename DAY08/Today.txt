when we you are creating a hook use camel casing and use "use " in front of file 


we generally do name export with the helper component and default with the 

window online event in js 


everytime a new eventListnerWillCreated or not 

always a good practice to clear our eventListner when you go out of the component

there is an issue if we bundle our entire project code inside a bundle it reduce the perforemance of cde very less


seprate them into logical bundle
